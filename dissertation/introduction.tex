\section{Project Introduction}
The purpose of this project was to construct a service report application. Many if not all technicians for car and machinery rental companies have to do a report of a repair or service that is carried out on a vehicle. This is usually handwritten, filled out on Excel or a PDF editor which can be quite tedious.This app will go through a report on a step by step format. There currently is no app for just doing this so I believe this could be a very useful app.
