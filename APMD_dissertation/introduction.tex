\section{Project Introduction}
My app will be a service/repair reporter. Many if not all Technicians for car and machinery
Dealerships/rental companies have to do a report any time a repair or service is carried out on a
vehicle. This is usual handwritten, filled out on excel or a pdf editor which can be quite tedious. My
app will go through a report step by step from the hours / mileage to the time it took to complete
job, this report when completed will save ( for example) to a jobs list database. It will put the
information/data and once the report is completed the data will be saved into a file located in the
data storage or a database and then outputted to a .pdf file of a report form. There currently is no
app just for doing this so I believe this could be a very useful app.
